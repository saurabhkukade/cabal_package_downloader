* Cabal Package Download-er
  This is a python script to download and install cabal package.
  I needed this script because I did not find any good utility
  to download cabal package into sandbox, So I wrote this script
  which resolve dependencies of given package and download all
  of them to sandbox location. 

* How to Run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  sudo python cabalRecDownLoader.py <package-name> <package-version> <sandbox-path>
  #+END_PRC
